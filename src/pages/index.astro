					<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
					<div class="faq-grid">
						<details class="faq-item">
							<summary>What programming languages can I use?</summary>
							<p>
								You can use Python 3. Many common external libraries will be
								available for use. If you'd like to use any others, you can
								request them in our Discord.
							</p>
						</details>

						<details class="faq-item">
							<summary>How many people can be on a team?</summary>
							<p>
								Teams can be between 1 and 2 people from any U.S. university.
							</p>
						</details>

						<details class="faq-item">
							<summary>What poker variant will be used?</summary>
							<p>
								The specific poker variant will be revealed when the competition
								starts. It will be more complex than standard no-limit Texas
								Hold 'em. The finals will feature a slightly different variant.
							</p>
						</details>

						<details class="faq-item">
							<summary>What are the prizes?</summary>
							<p>
								The exact prize pool is still being finalized, but in total,
								$100,000 will be split between finalists. Stay tuned for prize
								announcements!
							</p>
						</details>

						<details class="faq-item">
							<summary>Is there a registration fee?</summary>
							<p>No, participation in the competition is completely free.</p>
						</details>

						<details class="faq-item">
							<summary>What frameworks are supported?</summary>
							<p>
								You only need to implement a simple interface we provide that
								tells your bot when it's your turn to act. You're free to use
								any approach you want - from simple rules to deep learning. For
								those interested in reinforcement learning, the game engine also
								implements the OpenAI Gym interface, and we'll provide example
								code for getting started with RL approaches.
							</p>
						</details>

						<details class="faq-item">
							<summary>How does the online phase work?</summary>
							<p>
								During the online portion, matches will be run continuously with
								approximately 20 matches per day per team. The matchmaking
								system is TBD. Teams can request a limited number of additional
								matches against specific opponents each day.
							</p>
						</details>

						<details class="faq-item">
							<summary>What happens at the finals?</summary>
							<p>
								The finals will be a 2-3 day in-person event at Jump Trading's
								offices in Chicago. Teams will compete in a round-robin format
								using a slightly modified variant of the game, with final
								rankings determined by overall winrate. Finalists will also have
								the chance to network with Jump traders, quants, engineers, and
								recruiters, and attend cool talks and social events.
							</p>
						</details>

						<details class="faq-item">
							<summary>Can I prepare my bot before knowing the variant?</summary
							>
							<p>
								Yes, you can do whatever you want before the competition, but
								you will likely have to make significant changes to work with
								the custom variant.
							</p>
						</details>

						<details class="faq-item">
							<summary>What resources are provided?</summary>
							<p>
								We provide a complete development framework, documentation,
								example bots, and weekly office hours with the organizing team.
								You'll also have access to our Discord community for support.
							</p>
